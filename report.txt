Potential Bugs
1.1. File Upload Issues

Symptom: Files are not being uploaded to the designated folders.
Potential Cause: The file upload function might not be triggered correctly or there could be an issue with the file storage configuration.
Suggested Action: Verify that the file upload route is correctly configured and ensure that the file handling logic is properly implemented.
1.2. API Endpoint Issues

Symptom: API endpoints are not responding as expected or returning errors.
Potential Cause: Possible issues with route handling, request validation, or service logic.
Suggested Action: Review the API endpoint implementations and their associated services. Ensure that error handling and validation are correctly implemented.
1.3. TypeScript Errors

Symptom: TypeScript errors related to property assignments and type mismatches.
Potential Cause: Type definitions might not match the expected data structure.
Suggested Action: Ensure that entity properties and DTOs are correctly defined and that type assignments match the expected data types.
1.4. Dependency Injection Errors

Symptom: NestJS unable to resolve dependencies for services.
Potential Cause: Dependencies may not be correctly provided or imported in the module configuration.
Suggested Action: Check module imports and ensure that all required providers are correctly registered.
2. Areas for Improvement
2.1. Code Organization

Suggestion: Improve code modularity by separating concerns into distinct modules and services.
Action: Refactor code to ensure that each module handles a specific aspect of the application, such as authentication, file handling, and bug reporting.
2.2. Error Handling

Suggestion: Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide more informative error messages.
Action: Implement custom exception filters and detailed error messages to aid in debugging and improve user experience.
2.3. Unit and Integration Tests

Suggestion: Increase test coverage for critical functionalities, including authentication, authorization, and file upload.
Action: Write comprehensive unit tests for services and integration tests for API endpoints to ensure robustness.
2.4. Documentation

Suggestion: Improve API documentation and ensure it is up-to-date.
Action: Use Swagger or a similar tool to document API endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication mechanisms.
2.5. Performance Optimization

Suggestion: Review performance bottlenecks and optimize where necessary.
Action: Conduct performance profiling and optimize database queries and file handling processes to improve overall system performance.
